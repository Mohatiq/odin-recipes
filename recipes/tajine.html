        <h4>Step-by-step Guide to Make our Tajine Ready for Lunch.</h4></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by setting your oven to 350 degrees and preparing your herbs and vegetables. Finely mince the garlic, parsley, and cilantro, dice the onion, and slice the preserved lemon into thin pieces.</li>
                <li>After that, pour half of the olive oil into the base of your tajine, along with all the minced garlic and chopped onion. Heat it over medium and saut√© the mixture until the onions become translucent, which should take roughly 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken on top of the onions in the tajine and sprinkle it with half of the parsley, the remaining olive oil, bloomed saffron, salt, pepper, ginger, paprika, cumin, and turmeric. Using your hands, mix everything thoroughly to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the spices.</li>
                <li>Spread the seasoned chicken evenly around the base of your tajine. Arrange the sliced preserved lemon and olives over top.</li>
                <li>Pour a little water over the chicken, then cover the tajine and bake for about 1 hour, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees. Check the dish every 30 minutes to ensure it's cooking evenly.</li>
                <li>Serve the chicken along with the flavorful sauce and vegetables from the tajine, accompanied by fresh homemade bread. Garnish with the remaining minced cilantro and parsley, and enjoy your meal!</li>
