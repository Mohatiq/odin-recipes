        <h4>How to Make Preserved Lemons. </h4>   
            <ol>
                <li>Thoroughly wash and scrub the lemons to remove any dirt from the skin. Cut them into quarters, but not all the way through, keeping the lemon intact. Generously rub salt into each section.</li>
                <li>Squeeze into your canning jars and sprinkle with more extra salt.</li>
                <li>Pour lemon juice over the salted lemons, ensuring that thereâ€™s enough liquid to fully submerge them. Loosely seal the container with the lid.</li>
                <li>Let sit on the counter for 1 week before moving to the fridge for 2 more weeks or until the skin is soft and can be easily punctured with a butter knife. Use in sauces, marinades and with roasted dishes! </li>
